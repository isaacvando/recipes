# Dumplings

**gluten free:** If you use gluten-free flour, you will need to make a lot more dough as it does not get as thin as wheat flour.  
**freezing:** These freeze well. If you would like so, freeze the dumplings before cooking. You can then cook them directly from frozen.

## Ingredients
- **1/4 lbs** ground pork
- **2/3 cup** cabbage
- **1 t** rice vinegar
- **1 T** soy sauce
- **1 t** sesame oil
- **1 t** garlic chili sauce
- **1 T** minced garlic
- **some** green onion
- **some** pepper
- **1 cup** flour
- **6 T** warm water
- **some** high heat oil
- **1/4 cup** water

## Cookware
- **1** pan
- **1** lid

## Steps
1. Thoroughly combine the **ground pork (1/4 lbs)**, finely chopped **cabbage (2/3 cup)**, **rice vinegar (1 t)**, **soy sauce (1 T)**, **sesame oil (1 t)**, **garlic chili sauce (1 t)**, **minced garlic (1 T)**, **green onion (some)**, and **pepper (some)**.
2. Combine the **flour (1 cup)** and **warm water (6 T)**; knead until formed. The dough will smell sweet and be soft to the touch. If at any point you need to let it sit, cover with a wet paper towel to prevent it from drying out.
3. Take a small chunk of the dough and form it into a disc. Place a dollop of filling in the middle and crimp the edges into a dumpling shape.
4. Heat up **high heat oil (some)** in a **pan** with a **lid**. Once it is hot, line the pan with dumplings. Cook for **2 minutes** and then add **water (1/4 cup)**. Cover and let steam for **4-5 minutes**. Finally remove the lid and let cook until the rest of the water cooks off.
5. Serve with [dumpling sauce](./Dumpling%20Sauce.md) and enjoy\!
