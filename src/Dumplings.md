gluten free: If you use gluten-free flour, you will need to make a lot more dough as it does not get as thin as wheat flour.
freezing: These freeze well. If you would like so, freeze the dumplings before cooking. You can then cook them directly from frozen.

# Dumplings

## Ingredients

- *1/4 lbs* ground pork
- *2/3 c* cabbage
- *1 t* rice vinegar
- *1 T* soy sauce
- *1 t* sesame oil
- *1 t* garlic chili sauce
- *1 T* minced garlic
- green onion
- pepper
- *1 c* flour
- *6 T* warm water
- high heat oil
- *4 tbsp* water

## Cookware

- pan
- lid

## Steps

1. Thoroughly combine the ground pork, finely chopped cabbage, rice vinegar, soy
sauce, sesame oil, garlic chili sauce, minced garlic, green onion, and pepper.

2. Combine the flour and warm water; knead until formed. The dough will smell
sweet and be soft to the touch. If at any point you need to let it sit, cover
with a wet paper towel to prevent it from drying out.

3. Take a small chunk of the dough and form it into a disc. Place a dollop of
filling in the middle and crimp the edges into a dumpling shape.

4. Heat up high heat oil in a pan with a lid. Once it is hot, line the pan with
dumplings. Cook for 2 minutes and then add water. Cover and let steam for 4-5
minutes. Finally remove the lid and let cook until the rest of the water cooks
off.

5. Serve with [dumpling sauce](./Dumpling%20Sauce.md) and enjoy!
