>> note: pork butt works well also.

Cover the #pork shoulder{5 lbs} with the #italian dressing seasoning packet{}, @pepper{lots}, and @salt{}. Keep in mind that the seasoning packet is salty, so don't overdo it.

Place in the #crockpot{} and cover with #roughly diced onion{}, and #roughly chopped garlic{}.

Cook on low for 6-8 hours, shred, and enjoy!
