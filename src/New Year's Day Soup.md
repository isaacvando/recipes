- *8 oz* ham

## Cookware

- large pot

## Steps

1. In a large pot, sautee the diced onion, diced bell pepper, diced carrot, and
garlic in butter and oil.

2. Add the kale, diced, dried, deseeded chiles (guajillo, ancho, arbol), apple
cider vinegar, diced tomatoes, green chiles, thyme, black pepper, and vegetable
broth. Simmer for 30 minutes.

3. Roughly smash half of the black eyed peas with a fork, and add them all to
the soup. Add the white beans.

4. Add the ham and simmer for another 30 minutes. If the ham is the fancy kind
with fat on it, you should put it in much earlier in the process.

5. Enjoy!
