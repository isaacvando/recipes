# About This Repository

These recipes are written in the [cook](https://cooklang.org/) markdown language. It is concise and allows for consistent formatting across all recipes. I use a VSCode extension I wrote called [Cook Render](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=isaacvando.cookrender) to convert the `.cook` files into `.md`.

Many of the recipes do not have all of the quantities listed because its just the kind of thing you've gotta feel.
